"""Custom physics kernels for the Sensorium Manifold.

These represent the core of the research behind the Sensorium Manifold.
This has not been a direct effort towards Machine Learning, and neither
an ambition to implement a full-fledged physics simulation.
I did however, always have A.I. in mind, and had been thinking of a less
controlled (tunable) information management system for a while.
The intuition that physics already solves a similar problem is what this
project further explores.
