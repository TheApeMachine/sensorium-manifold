"""CUDA/Triton backend for real-space thermodynamic domain and coherence domain

This implements the physics simulation for the Sensorium Manifold.
Please understand that what is implemented here does not claim to be a full
resolution model, but a utility bounded implementation that represents the
functional border where the system behaves aligned to its intended purpose.
